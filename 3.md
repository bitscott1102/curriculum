<!--title={Separate Route Files Pt. 1}-->

<!--concepts={web development}-->

When you have a lot of routes defined on one page like ours, *Index.js*, the lines may get pretty long due to  how many routes we need to define. Logically, it makes sense to split up our routes by their subject. So we would split up the `user` routes and the `tasks` routes. 

Our first steps is to define the router in *index.js*, then split up the files. Try adding the following code below that uses the keyword `new` to define the new router: 

```javascript
const router = new express.Router()
```

This creates a router for express to use, but now we need to define the router.

```javascript
router.get('/test', (req,res) => { 
	res.send('This is from my other router')
})
app.use(router)
```

If we go to **localhost:3000/test**, it will show 'This is from my other router'. So we see the following structure: 

1. Create a new router using the `new` keyword. 
2. Define the route in a function
3. Tell our app to use the new route.
