Create a function `get_key_press` which has a parameter `key` for which key is pressed and then adds directions to the direction queue if a key in `KEY_MAPPING` is pressed.

`KEY_MAPPING` is defined as the following:

```python
KEY_MAPPING = {(pg.K_LEFT, pg.K_a) : "left", (pg.K_RIGHT, pg.K_d) : "right",               (pg.K_UP, pg.K_w) : "up", (pg.K_DOWN, pg.K_s) : "down"}
```

`pg.K_LEFT` simply corresponds to the event where a left arrow is pressed.

`pg.K_a` corresponds to the event where 'a' is pressed. 

So what this dictionary is saying is that both the left arrow and the 'a' key correspond to the "left" direction. In gaming, when we think about the arrow layout and WASD layout, then this makes sense. 

The rest of the arrow keys and WASD layout correspond to their proper directions by the dictionary definition.

Also, if the direction queue is full, do we really want to add any more keys? Account for that case.
