`check_collisions` checks for collisions with apples, its body, and the walls. 

How would you check if the snake has collided with the apple? Make sure to set your `growing` attribute appropriately. 

If it collides with the body or walls, set your `dead` attribute appropriately.

Some helpful things for handling body collision logic:

* You can use  `any()` which takes an iterable and returns `True` if at least one element of the iterable is true.
* Also `collections.Counter()` is a container that stores elements as dictionary keys and counts as dictionary values.
