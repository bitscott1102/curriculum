What other object(s) does the game have besides a snake? An apple!

Let's start by creating an `Apple` class.

The `Apple` class has the methods:

* `collide_with` which changes the apple to a new position after it has been hit
* `respawn` which picks and returns a random position on the board that is **not a wall or a snake**
  * The board is defined as a 2-element tuple represented by `BOARD_SIZE`
  * This function takes a parameter `obstacles`, which is a set of all of the wall positions and snake cell positions

An apple has a position which is determined by `respawn`, a color, and walls.

Note that for your constructor, you will have to combine two sets, and you can use the set operator `|` to do so. Our constructor will take in `walls` and `snake` and initialize the apple's `position`, `walls` and `color`. 

* for the Snake's color, reference `COLORS` in your starter code
