First make the function declaration:

```python
def __init__(self):
```

Next, initialize the attributes.

The snake has a color from the dictionary of `COLORS`:

```python
	self.color = COLORS["snake"]
```

It has a speed of 8 cells per second:

```python
	self.speed = 8 
```

Initialize the direction to up:

```python
	self.direction = "up"
```

There is also a tuple called vector that gets the change in coordinates from the dictionary `DIRECT_DICT` according to the direction:

```python
	self.vector = DIRECT_DICT[self.direction]
```

The snake has a body, which is a list of tuples as coordinates for the body:

```python
	self.body = [(10, 25), (10, 24)]
```

Also an attribute to make the body a set:

```python
	self.body_set = set(self.body)
```

A snake can be growing or not:

```python
	self.growing = False
```

Also how much the snake grows:

```python
	self.grow_number = 0
```

A timer can be represented as an integer:

```python
	self.timer = 0
```

A snake is dead or not:

```python
	self.dead = False
```

A queue of size 5 to keep track of which way to go next:

```python
	self.direction_queue = queue.Queue(5)
```
