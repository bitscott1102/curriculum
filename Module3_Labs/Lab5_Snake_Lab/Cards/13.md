Remember, the function `change_direction` simply updates the direction. Specifically, it initializes `self.vector` and `self.direction` to a new direction if it has been inputted but not executed yet.

If there is a new direction to be initialized, where would it be, and how would we get the first new inputted direction? 

And if there is no new direction, what should you do?

Be sure to check if the direction you obtain is parallel to the current direction. If so, should our snake's direction be updated according to the rules of Snake?
