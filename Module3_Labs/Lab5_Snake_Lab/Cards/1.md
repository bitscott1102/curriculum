For this lab we will be making the game snake.

Don't worry about the graphics! The code is already provided.

Here's how the game works:

- The player gets to move a snake around using the arrow keys
- An apple will be randomly placed on the board.
- When the snake collides with an apple, the snake grows and the apple respawns somewhere else on the board.
- The game ends when the snake collides with the wall or its body

We will be using object oriented programming in this game.

What is an object in this game? An apple!

Please note that this project requires **extensive reading of the starter code**, so please read the entire starter code before starting the lab.

Let's make the snake with a `Snake` class.

For your constructor, a snake has a color based on the global variable `COLORS`, a speed of 8, a direction of up, a vector that is the tuple vector which corresponds to the snake's default direction, a body represented as the list `[(10, 25), (10,24)]`, a `body_set` which is a set of the snake's body, an identifier that tracks whether it is growing or not, a grow number 0, a timer 0, an identifier that tracks whether it is dead or not, and a queue of size 5 to track the directions.

For your `Snake` class, you'll also configure two class methods:

* `change_direction`: Sets the snake's vector and direction based on the direction queue
  * Checks the direction queue for a new direction; directions parallel to the snake's current movement are ignored
  * Use the new direction from the queue, if the direction queue is empty, then the snake's original direction is used
  * Set the snake's vector and direction based on the found direction
  * The `OPPOSITES` and `DIRECT_DICT` variables will be helpful here
* `get_key_press` adds directions to the direction queue if key is pressed
  * takes in a `key` parameter
  * Checks if key is a valid direction press using `KEY_MAPPING`, if it is then place in the direction queue
    * Pay attention to the specific structure of `KEY_MAPPING`
  * The queue can be full, please account for that!
  * For your reference, `get_key_press` is ran every time a key is pressed
