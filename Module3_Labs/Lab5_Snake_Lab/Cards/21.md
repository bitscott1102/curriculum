We are making an `Apple` class!

Let's make a function `respawn` which returns a new position not on an obstacle, snake or wall. It also has a parameter called `obstacles`.

Some helpful things:

* A coordinate on the board is represented by a tuple.

* You can use `randrange()` in the `random` module to generate a random number from `0` to `BOARD_SIZE[i]`.
