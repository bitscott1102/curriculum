First start with the function declaration with the parameters apple and walls.

```python
def check_collisions(self, apple, walls):
```

Use `self.body[-1]` to get the head of the snake.

Check if the head has collided with the apple.

```python
	if self.body[-1] == apple.position:
```

If it has collided, call the `Apple` class's `collide_with` function to move the apple to a new spot.

```python
		apple.collide_with(self)
```

After the snake eats the apple, it grows. Set `growing` to `True`.

```python
		self.growing = True
```

If the snake has not collided with an apple, check if it has hit a wall.

```python
	elif self.body[-1] in walls:
```

If the snake hits a wall, it is dead.

```python
		self.dead = True
```

If the snake has not collided with an apple or the walls, then check if it has hit itself.

You can use  `any()` which takes an iterable and returns `True` if at least one element of the iterable is true.

Also `collections.Counter()` is a container that stores elements as dictionary keys and counts as dictionary values. This code finds all the positions that your body occupies, and if there is more than one of any of those positions, then the snake has hit itself.

```python
	elif any(val > 1 for val in collections.Counter(self.body).values()):
```

If the snake collides with itself, it is dead.

```python
		self.dead = True
```
