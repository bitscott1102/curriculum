First we need to make the `Apple` class.

```python
class Apple(object):
```

Now lets make the `respawn` function which has a parameter called `obstacles`.

```python
	def respawn(self, obstacles):
```

Then randomly pick a position on the board. A coordinate on the board is represented by a tuple.

You can use `randrange()` in `random ` module to generate a random number from `0` to `BOARD_SIZE[i]`.

```python
		position = tuple(random.randrange(BOARD_SIZE[i]) for i in (0,1))
```

Then check if the position is on an obstacle or not.

```python
		while position in obstacles:
```

If if is on an obstacles, pick a new position.

```python
			position = tuple(random.range(BOARD_SIZE[i]) for i in (0,1))
```

Finally, return `position` of the apple.

```python
		return position
```
