First, start with the function declaration.

```python
def change_direction(self):
```

Then get the first item in the direction_queue as a variable `new`. Set `block=False`, so exceptions will be raised.

```python
    try:
        new = self.direction_queue.get(block=False)
```

If the direction_queue is empty, get the direction that is an attribute of the snake in `new`.

```python
    except queue.Empty:
        new = self.direction
```

Then check if `new`  is not the same direction and opposite direction (both of which are parallel.

```python
    if new not in (self.direction, OPPOSITES[self.direction]):
```

If it is not in the same direction and opposite direction, set the direction and vector to `new`.

```python
        self.vector = DIRECT_DICT[new]
        self.direction = new
```
