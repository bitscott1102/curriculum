Because we organized the necessary translation data using dictionaries, we can easily look up a translation for each character in `word`! The function's comment says that the original string for `word` is not modified. This means that we need to declare a new variable to return the translated string. Use a **for loop** to iterate through each character of `word` and translate it character by character.
