```python
def main():
    ''' Translates a single word into another word using a new alphabet
        First, creates dictionary of new alphabet, then continuously asks
        user for words to translate and prints out the translation until they
        type Enter
    '''




        engWord = input("Old Word: ")

        if (engWord == ""):
            break
        
        # generate word using newly defined alphabet
        word = translate(newAlphabet, engWord)

        print("New Word: " + word + "\n")
```

We then pass in the new alphabet **string** into `createAlphabet` and handle the alphabet creation in that function instead of `main()` since we don't want to clutter our `main()` too much.

```python
# generate pseudo-alphabet and store into dictionary
newAlphabet = createAlphabet(encoding)
```

Then, we have a **while loop** to continuously ask the user for words to translate. The user exits the program when they only type Enter, which is equivalent to the **empty string**.

```python
# translate words until user ends program
while (True):
    print("Enter a word to translate using the new encoding (Enter to exit)")
```

In each iteration, we also have to obtain user input using `input()`. Store this into `engWord` for the English translation of the word (since we are translating away from English).

```python
	engWord = input("Old Word: ")
```

The user can request to end the program when they type only Enter. `engWord` would then be the **empty string**.

```python
	if (engWord == ""):
        break
```

If the user did enter some word, then attempt to translate this by calling `translate()`.

```python
    # generate word using newly defined alphabet
    word = translate(newAlphabet, engWord)
```

Then print out the result which is `word`

```python
    print("New Word: " + word + "\n")
```
