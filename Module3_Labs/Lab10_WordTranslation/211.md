First, we have to obtain valid user input. We will keep asking the user for valid input and repeat if their input is invalid forever using a **while loop**.

```python
# obtain user input
while (True):
    print("Please enter 26 characters for your new alphabet")
    print("The first character replaces 'a', and the last character replaces 'z'")
    encoding = input()
```

Note this is an **infinite loop,** and we break out of it when valid input (a 26 character string) is entered.

```python
# obtain user input
while (True):
    print("Please enter 26 characters for your new alphabet")
    print("The first character replaces 'a', and the last character replaces 'z'")
    encoding = input()
    if (len(encoding) == 26):
        break
    print("Not 26 characters")
```

Next, we need to use a **dictionary** to hold our new encoding, as well as the English alphabet as a string to hold the original English encoding.

```python
# declare necessary variables
newAlphabet = {}
engAlphabet = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
```

**Note**: Instead of a dictionary, we could use a string, but then we would have to change our translation function to accommodate this.

We could declare `newAlphabet` with 26 blank variables, but this isn't necessary. We loop through each character in `charEncoding` and pair them up with the letters in the English Alphabet. Since we know there are always going to be 26 characters, we could do `for i in range(0, 26):`. Then, we return the dictionary.

```python
# create the new alphabet
i = 0
for newChar in charEncoding:
    engChar = engAlphabet[i]
    newAlphabet[engChar] = newChar
    i += 1
```

Finally, return the result `newAlphabet`

```python
return newAlphabet
```
