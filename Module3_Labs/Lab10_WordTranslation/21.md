Analyze the goal of this function in a very general sense. Each **character** of `charEncoding` becomes a **value** in the **dictionary** to return.

Let's call that dictionary `newAlphabet`. If the first letter  in `charEncoding` is 'T', the first **key-value pair** in `newAlphabet` will have ('a' : 'T'), since we are translating from the English alphabet to a new alphabet. Then, `newAlphabet['a']` will give 'T'.
