We already have all the data stored in the `alphabet`. When we index it with a character in the original English alphabet 'a' through 'z', we will get the corresponding, translated character (which could be anything).

```python
alphabet[char]
```

Append each translation to `newWord`, which will hold the resulting, translated word.

```python
newWord += alphabet[char]
```

We have to do this for every character of `newWord`, and we can do this by iterating using a **for loop**

```python
newWord = ""
for char in word:
    newWord += alphabet[char]
```

Then we return the result `newWord`

```python
return newWord
```
