# TDD

TDD stands for Test Driven Devlopment which refers to a practice that repeats a certain process. 

To run a TDD test, you do the following:

1. Create a test.
    You create tests that will test certain functions and continue creating more tests to test other functions.

2. Run all tests and see if any new test fails.
    You need to confirm if your test cases are failing.
3. Write some code.
    After you have determined the test failed, create a simple code that will pass the test.
4. Run tests and Refactor code.
    Using the code you just wrote, run the tests again and confirm it is now passing. After that,
    refactor that code into your actual code. Run the tests again to see if it passes the test.
5. Repeat.
    Repeats the steps before to check if the code will fail any other tests.
