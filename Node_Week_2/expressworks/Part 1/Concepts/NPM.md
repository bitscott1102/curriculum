## NPM

NPM stands for Node Package Manager that has two main components. Firstly, it is an online repository that contains
Node.js projects. This repository has many packages that you can download for free.
Secondly, it is a command-line utility for that respository that will
help in package installation, version management, and dependency management.

It is very easy to download and install a package using command line!

For example:

```
$ npm install <package>
```

This line will download ``package`` which will be the name of the files you are trying to download.
