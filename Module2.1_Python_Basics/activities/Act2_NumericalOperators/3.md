Now that we have Boolean and comparative operators down, we can actually go an extra step further with **Boolean operators**. These allow us to compare multiple expressions at one time.

There are 3 Boolean operators: `not`, `and`, and `or`. 



The **not** operator is pretty intuitive - it switches the Boolean value of an expression to the opposite value. The simplest example of the `not` operator's function is this:

```python
not True
```

The return value of `not True` is `False`. With the same logic, `not False` returns `True`.

The "truth table" for the `not` operator is as shows:

| `not` | True    | False  |
| ----- | ------- | ------ |
|       | `False` | `True` |





The **and** operator will return `True` if both expressions on its left and right are True. If even one expression is False, the return value will be `False`. 

Here is the "truth table" showing the possible returns for any 2 combinations of expressions using the `and` operator :

| `and`     | True    | False   |
| --------- | ------- | ------- |
| **True**  | `True`  | `False` |
| **False** | `False` | `False` |

Let's return to our sticker example! Here's a refresher of the values we used earlier.

```python
alice = 12
bob = 8
carol = 12
dennis = 5   
```

If we want to see if Alice and Carol have an equal number of stickers, *and* if Dennis has less stickers than Bob, we would test this by typing the following into Python:

```python
alice == carol and dennis < bob
```

Because the expression on the left side of the `and` operator is true (12 is equal to 12), and the right expression is also true (5 is less than 8), the whole expression returns `True`. 

If we tweaked the expression on the right side a little bit to check if Dennis has *more* stickers than Bob, it would look something like this:

``` python
alice == carol and dennis > bob
```

The return value of this expression would be `False`, because although the left expression is true, the right expression is false.  



The **or** operator will return `True` if at least one expression is true. It will only return `False` when both the left and right expressions are false.

Here is the "truth table" showing the possible returns for any 2 combinations of expressions using the `or` operator:

| `or`      | True   | False   |
| --------- | ------ | ------- |
| **True**  | `True` | `True`  |
| **False** | `True` | `False` |

If we want to see if Dennis had more stickers than Alice or Bob, we would type:

```python
dennis > alice or dennis > bob
```

Because `dennis > alice` is false (`5 > 12` is false) and `dennis > bob` is also false (`5 > 8` is false), the whole expression `dennis > alice or dennis > bob` returns `False`.
