There are 3 **conditional operators** in Python, **if**, **elif**, and **else**. When paired with the **Boolean values**, they can be used to set conditions for when you want your code to run. 



The function of the **if** operator similar to its definition in English! For example, in English, you might say something like "If it rains tomorrow, remember to bring an umbrella with you." The only thing now to note is the syntax, or the structure of the code, associated with using `if`.

```python
if condition:
    action
```

`if` is always followed by an expression that explains the condition under which it'll run and a semicolon (";"). The line after that contains the instructions that Python should follow if the condition is met.

For example, if you want to check and print back whether a user-inputted number is positive, you would use the following code:

```python
number = int(input('Enter an integer:'))
if number > 0:
    print(number, 'is a positive number.')
```



The **else** operator is also very easy to understand, it has the same meaning as it does in English. The `else` action will only be executed if the `if` condition is not met. The `else` operator can only be used if a `if` condition precedes it. The syntax for `else` is as follows:

```python
if condition:
    action1
else:
    action2
```

Continuing the example from earlier, we can add an `else` statement so that we will print to the user if they inputted a number less than zero.

```python
number = int(input('Enter an integer:'))
if number > 0:
    print(number, 'is a positive number.')
else: 
    print(number, 'is not a positive number.')
```

An `else` statement is not required when writing `if` statements. It can be omitted if you don't want to take any action if the conditions in the `if` statement are not met. But, there can only be one `else` statement following an `if` statement.



But what if you wanted to check multiple expressions for True? This is where **elif** comes into play.`elif` is a contraction of the words "else" and "if". The action in the `elif` block is run if the following 2 conditions are met: 

* the condition in the `if` statement is not met
* the condition in the `elif` statement is met

The use of `elif` in code looks like this:

```python
if condition1:
    action1
elif condition2:
    action2
else:
    action3
```

We can also apply this to our positive numbers code! Since zero is neither a positive nor negative number, we'll use `if` and `elif` to check if a number is positive or negative or if the number is neither (this is where the `else` statement comes into play!)

```python
number = int(input('Enter an integer:'))
if number > 0:
    print(number, 'is a positive number.')
elif number < 0:
    print(number, 'is a negative number.')
else: 
    print(number, 'is neither positive nor negative.')
```
