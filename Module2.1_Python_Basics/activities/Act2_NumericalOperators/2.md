In addition to operators that perform math computations, Python also has **comparative operators**. These operators often work hand in hand with **Boolean values** to check conditions.



Firstly, we will cover the **Boolean values**. There are 2 Boolean values in Python: **True** and **False**. These are the return values for evaluating expressions. To better understand how Boolean values are used in Python, let's take a look at a list of the comparative operators. You may have seen something similar in your math class, they are as follows:

| Conditional Operator | Functionality                                                |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| ==                   | If 2 values are equal, returns True                          |
| !=                   | If 2 values are not equal, returns True                      |
| >                    | If the left value is greater than the right value, returns True |
| \>=                  | If the left value is greater than or equal to the right value, returns True |
| <                    | If the left value is less than the right value, returns True |
| <=                   | If the left value is less than or equal to the right value, returns True |



Let's imagine a scenario where we have 4 students – Alice, Bob, Carol, and Dennis – who have 12, 8, 12, and 5 snazzy vinyl stickers, respectively, and we want to compare the students' sticker counts. We can start by creating variables for each person, storing the number of stickers they have.

```python
alice = 12
bob = 8
carol = 12
dennis = 5   
```



Now, we can apply the comparative operators! To check if Alice and Bob have the same number of stickers, we would use the `==` operator to compare their sticker counts. 

```python
alice == bob	
```

This expression would return `False`, because `alice = 12` and `bob = 8`, and 12 and 8 are not equal. 

However, if we compared Alice's sticker count with Carol's,

```python
alice == carol
```

we would get a return value of `True`, because the values stored in `alice` and `carol` are both 12. 



Here are some more examples of the comparative operators in action! 

| Expression        | Return  | Reasoning                                                    |
| ----------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `alice != dennis` | `True`  | `alice = 12` and `dennis = 5`,<br />12 and 5 are not equal values |
| `dennis > bob`    | `False` | `dennis = 5` and `bob = 8`,<br />5 is not greater than 8     |
| `dennis >= carol` | `False` | `dennis = 5 ` and `carol = 12`,<br />5 is not greater than or equal to 12 |
| `bob < alice`     | `True`  | `bob = 8` and `alice = 12`,<br />8 is less than 12           |
| `carol <= alice`  | `True`  | `carol = 12` and `alice = 12`,<br />12 is equal to 12        |
