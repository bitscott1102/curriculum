 <!--title={Resource Deleting Endpoints Pt. 1}-->

<!--concepts={web development}-->

Great! Now we need an HTTP endpoint for deleting a resource. We'll need one for deleting users, and one for deleting tasks. 



Express provides a method for deleting tasks, called `delete()` . First, let's focus on deleting a user.



How will we find a user to delete? We need the users id, which will be required in the url. Start off with the following code that we'll fill in, which also adds the asynchronous function: 

```javascript
app.delete('/users/:id', async (req, res)=> { 
  try { 
  
  } catch(e) { 
  
  }
})
```

In the `try` block, let's try to delete a user. The method to do so in MongoDB is `findByIdAndDelete()`. This function does exactly what it's namesake is. So, it needs an id. Try the following: 

```javascript
try { 
	const user = await User.findByIdAndDelete(req.params.id)
}
```

In the above, we wait for MongoDB to find our user by id, and store in the `const` variable `user`. Let's add more. 

```javascript
try { 
	const user = await User.findByIdAndDelete(req.params.id)
  
  if (!user) { 
  	return res.status(404).send()
  }
  
  res.send(user)
}
```

Now our function send a response of a 404 error if we can't find the user we want to delete. Or, if we did find a user, send the user back to the client. 



In the next card, you'll fill out the catch block!
