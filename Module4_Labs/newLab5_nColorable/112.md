In the algorithm, we can use **DFS** to inspect all of the nodes in our graph and assign a color to each node. In order to speed up the process, we can use **Backtracking Search**. Backtracking search will keep track of which colors are valid for a specific vertex. A color is valid if no nodes connected to it already have that same color. If no possible color can be assigned to a vertex (no valid color exists for this node), the program will determine that the graph is not n-colorable.
