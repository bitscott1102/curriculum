Now that we have a list of neighboring spaces, we have to check if each neighboring space has been visited or not. Initialize another list to be the **non-visited** neighbors. For each neighboring space, if the neighboring space is <u>not a wall and has not been visited yet</u> we add this neighbor to the list of non-visited neighbors. Remember that the `*` character constitutes a wall in our maze files, and a `.` constitutes an open path.

 Return this list after it has been created.
