To iterate through a 2D array, we will have to use for loops and the `range` function to determine the number of iterations needed:

```python
for i in range(len(maze)): # len(maze) is the length of a row    
    for j in range(len(maze[0])): # len(maze[0]) is the length of a column - always uniform
```

Within these nested for loops, we check if each maze 'cell' is equal to the letter 'e', if so we return the tuple([i, j]):

```python
        if maze[i][j] == 'e':    
            return tuple([i, j])
```

Let's see a visual example again using the same sample maze from before:

This time we want to find the `e` character. We do the same kind of traversal as we did in `findStart()`  until we find the index of our endpoint. In this case, we would return `(0,8)`.
