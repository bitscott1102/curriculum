To iterate through a 2D array, we will have to use for loops and the `range` function to determine the number of iterations needed:

```python
for i in range(len(maze)): # len(maze) is the length of a row    
    for j in range(len(maze[0])): # len(maze[0]) is the length of a column - always uniform
```

Within these nested for loops, we check if each maze 'cell' is equal to the letter 's', if so we return the tuple([i, j]):

```python
        if maze[i][j] == 's':    
            return tuple([i, j])
```

Let's see a visual example:

In this sample maze, we start at row 0, column 0, and search by *column* (moving through a row), until we find the index of our starting point. In this case, we would return `(0,3)`.
