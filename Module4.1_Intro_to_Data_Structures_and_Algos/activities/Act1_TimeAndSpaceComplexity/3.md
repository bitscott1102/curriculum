<!--title={Time as a Function}-->

To summarize briefly so far, the time of an algorithm or function's run time will be the sum of the time it takes for all the lines in the code of the algorithm to run. This runtime growth can be written as a function. 

Remember that elementary functions such as  `+, -, *, \, =` always take a constant amount of time to run. **Thus, when we see these functions, we assign them the value *c* time.** 

### How can we tell the time complexity just from the function?

Going back to our function `valueSum`, 

```python
value = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

def valueSum(value):
	sum = 0
	for i in value:
    	sum = sum + i
    return sum
```

From before, we analyzed `valueSum()` line by line and got `f(n) = c2*n + c1 + c3` when we added everything. This equation is actually a function of time where *n* is the input size and *f(n)* is the runtime; we can treat *f(n)* as *Time(Input)*. We can use the fastest growing term to determine the behavior of the equation; in this case, it is the **c2 * n** term. If we simply look at `Time(Input) = c2*n`, we know easily that the function is linear and that the runtime of `valueSum()` is *linear*.

Let's look at the function `three` again:

```python
value = range(6)

def three(value):
    sum = 0
    return(sum)
```

Previously, we found `sum = 0` to have a runtime of **c1** and `return(sum)` to have a runtime of **c2**. Adding them together, we get the function of time `Time(Input) = c1 + c2`. We can treat *c1 + c2* as one constant and call it **c3**. Now we have `T(I) = c3`. This makes it very obvious that the runtime of `three()` is *constant*.

Let's do the same for `listInList()`:
```python
keypad = [[1, 2, 3], 
          [4, 5, 6],
          [7, 8, 9],
          [0]] 
def listInList(keypad):
    sum = 0
    for row in keypad:
        for i in row:
            sum += i
    return sum
```

We deducted that `sum = 0` has constant runtime **c1**, the loop structure has runtime of **n^2**, and `return sum` runs in **c2** time. Putting it into a function, we get `Time(Input) = n^2 + c1 + c2`. If we isolate the fastest growing term, we get `T(I) = n^2` which reveals the runtime to be *quadratic*.
