<!--title={Separate Route Files Pt. 3}-->

<!--concepts={web development}-->

Now that we have the file *user.js* and *tasks.js* ready to export, we just need to use import them into our *index.js file*!



In your *index.js* file, add next to your other require statements: 

```javascript
const userRouter = require('./routers.user')
```

And, below the use express line, add: 

```javascript
app.use(userRouter)
```

Nice! Notice all we did was separate the code from one file into a separate file to clean up our code, making minimal changes. Do the same for tasks, and test your function using Postman. Everything should run the same!
