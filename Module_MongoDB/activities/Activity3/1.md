### Value inside _id

The IDs are known as GUIDs (Globally Unique Identifiers) and allow MongoDB servers to scale well and handle traffic. There's no potential for IDs conflicting.

You can create an ID by the following steps:

Let's start by getting all the modules!

There two ways to go about getting `mongodb`, `MongoClient`, and `ObjectID`. We can either do the following, which is the most straightforward way:

```js
const mongodb = require('mongodb')
const MongoClient = mongodb.MongoClient
const ObjectID = mongodb.ObjectID
```

Or, we can *destructure*, which is a convenient way of extracting multiple values from data stored in  objects and arrays.

```js
// or destructure
const { MongoClient, ObjectID } = require('mongodb')
```
