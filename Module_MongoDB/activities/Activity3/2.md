Now, we have these modules, we can create our own ObjectIDs:

```javascript
// create our own ids
const id = new ObjectID()
console.log(id); // 5df9af9cfaed11190801dfc2
```

You will be able to see the value in your console. The ID is not completely random. The three components of this unique 12-byte `objectID` are:

- specific time object was created (4-bytes)
- randomly generated value (5-bytes)
- counter starting with a random value (3-bytes)

You can print out the exact time you created an object by using:

```javascript
console.log(id.getTimestamp());
// 2019-12-18T04:57:38.000Z
```

*Note that since MongoDB already creates a unique ObjectID for us whenever we insert a document, we do not need to do this at all. This is only if you wanted to create ObjectIDs on your own.*
