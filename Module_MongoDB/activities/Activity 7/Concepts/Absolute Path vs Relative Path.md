The first difference you'll notice between the two different types of links is that absolute paths *always* include the domain name of the website, including **http://www.**, whereas relative links only point to a file or a file path. When a user clicks a relative link, the browser takes them to that location on the current site. For that reason, you can only use relative links when linking to pages or files within your site, and you must use absolute links if you're linking to a location on another website.
