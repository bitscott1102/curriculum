The `Model.find(...)` function will find multiple objects and takes in a search query to do so. For us, since we want to find all the objects, we'll be passing in an empty query, but we could easily pass in a `age` to search for all objects with that specific `age`. Notice that the function also returns a `Promise` with data on the user, so we can handle the response properly.

Continuing on our HTTP request:

```js
app.get('/users', (req, res) => {
    User.find({}).then((users) => {
        
    }).catch((e) => {
        
    })
})
```

So if the request was successful, we'll send back all the users. If not, then we can send back the error, which may likely arise if the database connection was lost. Note that the error would be a status 500 error.

```js
app.get('/users', (req, res) => {
    User.find({}).then((users) => {
        res.send(users)
    }).catch((e) => {
        res.status(500).send()
    })
})
```

Now let's test it!

Head over to Postman and create a new request *Read users*. It'll stay as a `GET` request and we can put in the URL as `localhost:3000/users`

![mongo-db-9-read-users](https://projectbit.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/darlene/labs/mongodb-9-read-users.png)

and click send! You should get back your list of users with all data in the database.
