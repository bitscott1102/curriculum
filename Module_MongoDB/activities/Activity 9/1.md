Continuing on our CRUD operations, we will now focus on reading data from our database. 

For reading, we will be learning how to perform two operations:

* Finding all objects
* Finding object by ID

In `/routers/user.js`, Let's start with our traditional HTTP request pattern, with a URL and callback:

```js
app.get('/users', (req, res) => {
    
})
```

From here, `Mongoose` provides us with specific reading functions located on the [Mongoose API](https://mongoosejs.com/docs/queries.html). 

There is a whole list of C**RUD** operations there, but we'll be using two of them for our purposes:

* `Model.find(...)`
* `Model.findById(...)`

where Model refers to the models we created like `User` or `Task`

You may have noticed another find operation: `Model.findOne`, which can be useful for finding a single object with a query.
