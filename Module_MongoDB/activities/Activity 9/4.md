We have covered how to find all objects with `Model.find(...)` and find an object using the ID with `Model.findById(...)` through the database. Now let's try to implement these for our tasks database in `routers/task.js`.

Outline:

* Create an endpoint for getting all tasks
* Create an endpoint for getting a task by its `_id`
* Setup new corresponding requests in Postman and test them

You may reference your code you used for the users database.
