# Resource Creation Endpoints: Part I

The way that users are created are by using POST requests. Incoming parameters need to be parsed by our application and new users need to be created.

**Note:** this is why we moved the user code from **mongoose.js** to a new file, so we can create a user for each incoming POST request!

###Configure index.js with Express

First, we need to make sure we can host our server with Express, and be able to take and parse incoming POST requests.

To set up Express, you will need to require it in **index.js**, create **const app** and **const port**, and set up the listener function:

```javascript
const express = require('express')

const app = express()
const port = process.env.PORT || 3000

app.listen(port, () => {
	
})
```

If we visit a browser at local port 3000, nothing happens. Why? Because we have not configured Express to do anything!

Before, we used ```app.get``` to allow someone to access a given route by using the HTTP get method, but now, we are going to work the ```app.post``` method to create resources.

The function is mostly the same, with the first parameter being the path expressed in the POST request, and the second being a callback function with the request and result handlers. This time, our path will be **/users** and we will print a message to the console to ensure our method is working:

```javascript
app.post('/users', (req, res) => {
	res.send('testing!')
})
```
