# Resource Creation Endpoints: Part II

To be able to test our application, we need POST requests! The easiest way to do this, is with Postman.

###Configure Postman

Inside of Postman, create a new collection called Task App. Add a request to the Task App collection. You can name it something like: *"Create user"*

Set the request method to be POST and configure its URL to be localhost:3000/users otherwise it will not work!

**Note:** remember you defined the path in the POST function to be '/users'

Now, you can fire off the request and see the message ```testing!``` from **index.js** inside the console.

###Input

Realistically, our users will have additional parameters. To be able to configure the POST request, navigate from the **Params** tab to **Body** inside of Postman. By default, **none** is selected but switch that over to **raw** and from the new drop down, select **JSON**. Create your very own user:

```javascript
{
	"name": Max
	"email": max@example.com
	"password": $yellow123
}
```

This is the data we are going to be using to fire off a sample POST request. You can try to fire off the request and see the same ```testing!``` message.
