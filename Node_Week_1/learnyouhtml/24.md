Sites often have sign-up pages with input fields for your email or username and password. In this exercise, we'll discuss how you can create such HTML elements.

First of all, we need to start from `<form>` element, which represents a document section that contains interactive controls to submit information to a web server.



A `<form>` element has a lot of attributes, here are the most important of them:

* **action** - The URL of a program that processes the form information.
* **method** - The HTTP method that the browser uses to submit the form. Possible values are: 
  * post - corresponds to the HTTP POST method
  * get -   corresponds to the HTTP GET method.
* name - The name of the form. It must be unique among the forms in a document

[Here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/form#Attributes) is more information about `<form>`'s attributes.



Now that we know what `<form>` is, we can talk about `<input>`, the element that is used to accept data from the user. 

Here is a list of widely used `type` values:

* **text** - a single-line text field. Line-breaks are automatically removed from the input value
  * This is the default value for `type`!
* **button** - a clickable button
* **checkbox** - a box that can be checked off
  * the checked value attribute is used to indicate whether an item is checked off
* **file** - a control that allows the user to select a file
* **password** - a single-line text field whose value is obscured
* **radio** - a "radio button". They are similar to checkboxes, but you can only check off one radio button. Think of radio buttons like they're the options on a multiple choice test!
  * similar to checkbox, we use the the checked value attribute to indicate whether an item is checked off

* **submit** - a button that submits the form
