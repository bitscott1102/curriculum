In this exercise we are going to take a look at tag attributes.

Tag attributes extend the ability of tags and give us flexible control over different options for displaying elements or configuring their behavior. There are a lot of attributes for different purposes like color, size, address and so on.

You can specify attributes like this:

```html
 <tag attribute1="value1" attribute2="value2">some text</tag>
 <!-- or for self-closing tag -->
 <tag attribute1="value1" attribute2="value2">
```

The HTML specification mandates that all values of attributes be wrapped in double quotes (attribute="value") or single quotes (attribute='value').

Omitting these quotes wouldn't cause an error, because browsers, in most of cases, will handle this code correctly. However, you can get a problem if you try to define a value with spaces and don't wrap this value in quotes. Consider this example:

```html
 <!-- with double quotes -->
 <tag attribute="value with spaces"></tag>
 <!-- with single quotes -->
 <tag attribute='value with spaces'></tag>
 <!-- without quotes -->
 <tag attribute=value with spaces></tag>
```

In the third example above, we have got a problem. Only value would be used as a value of attribute, so with and spaces would be ignored as invalid attributes. That's why we suggest you to wrap values of attributes in quotes.

There are a few important things you need to remember: if you didn't specify an attribute, the browser will use default values for that attribute. The order of the attributes doesn't matter. And each attribute requires a specific type of value (text, number, path to file, etc).
