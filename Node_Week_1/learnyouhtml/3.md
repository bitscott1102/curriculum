Let's look at this code as an example. This will also be your boilerplate for all of your exercises, create a new empty file called index.html and copy these lines in. 

It's okay if you don't understand what's going on, these lines will be explained in the exercises to follow.

```html
 <!DOCTYPE html>
 <html>
   <head>
     <meta charset="utf-8">
     <title>Hello, world!</title>
   </head>
   <body>
     here is a body
   </body>
 </html>
```

Here we have a `<html>` tag which wraps around the whole document. This tag indicates where the HTML document begins and where it ends. Here we have a `<html>` tag which wraps the whole document — this tag indicates where the HTML document begins and where it ends.

The HTML document has its own `<head>` and `<body>`. In the `<head>` tag we put all information about document, like meta-tags and `<title>`. The content of the `<title>` tag will be shown in the browser's title bar when displaying this document. In the `<body>` we put everything we want to be drawn in browser's window: headings, text, images, etc.

Probably, you still have a question: "What does the `<meta charset="utf-8">` tag do?" Well, this is a special tag — a meta-tag. Meta-tags are used for describing a document. It's a bit weird, but keep thinking about meta-tags as an information about information. Directly, this tag means that we want to use the utf-8 charset for our document.
