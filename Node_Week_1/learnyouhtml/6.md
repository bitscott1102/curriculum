## ATTRIBUTES

### THE CHALLENGE

You're already familiar with the <img> tag from the previous exercise. This tag embeds an image in the page. This tag has a few important attributes:

* **src** - the image URL. This attribute is mandatory for the `<img>` element.  
* **alt** - this attribute defines the alternative text describing the image. Users will see this text displayed if the image URL is wrong or if the image is not yet downloaded.
* **height** - the intrinsic height of the image in pixels.  
* **width** - the intrinsic width of the image in pixels.



You need to create an HTML document with an image. Feel free to set any values for `src` and `alt` attributes.
