### Ordered Lists

If you need to create a list with numbered items, you should use `<ol>` tag. A `<ol>` stands for ordered list and represents an ordered list of items, typically rendered as a numbered list. A list item can be described using `<li>` tag, which stands for list item. Consider this example with ordered list markup:

```html
<ol>
	<li>first item</li>
	<li>second item</li>
	<li>third item</li>
</ol>
```

 Preview:

1. first item  
2. second item 
3. third item



Typically, ordered-list items are displayed with a preceding numbering, which can be of any form, like numerals, letters or Romans numerals or even simple bullets.

 A `<ol>` tag have useful attributes:

* **type** - indicates the numbering type, may has one of these values:  
  * 1 indicates numbers (default);
  * a indicates lowercase letters;
  * A indicates uppercase letters;
  * i indicates lowercase Roman numerals;
  * I indicates uppercase Roman numerals.
* **start** - this integer attribute specifies the start value for numbering the individual list items. Although the ordering type of list elements might be Roman numerals, such as XXXI, or letters, the value of start is always represented as a number. 
* **reversed** - a boolean attribute specifies that the items of the list are specified in reversed order.
