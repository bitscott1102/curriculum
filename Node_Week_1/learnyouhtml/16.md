## LISTS

### THE CHALLENGE

In your HTML document create three lists:

1. ordered list with 3 items
2. unordered list with 3 items
3. definition list with 2 term-and-definition pairs

The content of list items is up to you.



Solution:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
	<head>
		<meta charset="utf-8">
		<title>Lists</title>
	</head>
	<body>
		<ol>
			<li>Item 1</li>
			<li>Item 2</li>
			<li>Item 3</li>
		</ol>
		<ul>
			<li>Item 1</li>
			<li>Item 2</li>
			<li>Item 3</li>
		</ul>
		<dl>
			<dt>Term 1</dt>
			<dd>Definition 1</dd>
			<dt>Term 2</dt>
			<dd>Definition 2</dd>
		</dl>
	</body>
</html>
```



Since we're working with html, we need to encase the code with opening and closing `<html>` tags.

```html
<html>
	The rest of the stuff we write will go in here!
</html>
```



In the `<head>` tag, you're free to name whatever you want the site head to be using the `<title>` tag. For our example, we named the head "Lists". Also in the head tag is the `<meta>` tag, which in our example provides the Unicode character encoding for our HTML document. You don't worry about this part too much, it's just a note to the computer to tell it how to display the characters that you type in.

```html
<html>
    <head>
        <meta charset="utf-8"> 
        <title>Lists (or any other title!)</title>
    </head>
</html>
```



The `<body>` tag is where we'll actually create the lists! 

```html
<html>
    <head>
        <meta charset="utf-8"> 
        <title>Lists</title>
    </head>
    
    <body>
        Lists will go here!
    </body>
</html>
```

First, we'll create our ordered list with 3 items. The tag for ordered lists is `<ol>`, and it is paired with the closing tag `</ol>` to mark the end of the ordered list. And now, to add elements to our unordered list, we will use the list item tag (`<li>` and `</li>`). Put whatever you want to add to your list in between `<li>` and `</li>`.

```html
<html>
    <head>
        <meta charset="utf-8"> 
        <title>Lists</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <ol>
            <li>Item 1</li>
      		<li>Item 2</li>
      		<li>Item 3</li>
        </ol>
    </body>
</html>
```

Now, we can move onto the unordered list. It's actually super similar to how you would write an ordered list. The only thing that differs is the list type tag. For an ordered list, we would use `<ol>`, but for unordered lists, we use `<ul>`. Adding list items is the same exact process (sandwiching list items between `<li>` and `</li>`).

```html
<html>
	<head>
        <meta charset="utf-8">
        <title>Lists</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <ol>
            <li>Item 1</li>
            <li>Item 2</li>
            <li>Item 3</li>
        </ol>
        <ul>
            <li>Item 1</li>
            <li>Item 2</li>
            <li>Item 3</li>
        </ul>
    </body>
</html>
```

The last step of this challenge is creating the definition list. To do this, we will be using the `<dl>` tag to denote a definition list. 
Within the `<dl>` opening and closing tags, we will use term (`<dt>`) and definition (`<dd>`) tags. Use `<dt>` first to mark a word or phrase that you want to define, and then on a new line use the `<dd>` tag and provide the definition like this:

```html
<html>
	<head>
		<meta charset="utf-8">
		<title>Lists</title>
	</head>
	<body>
		<ol>
			<li>Item 1</li>
			<li>Item 2</li>
			<li>Item 3</li>
		</ol>
		<ul>
			<li>Item 1</li>
			<li>Item 2</li>
			<li>Item 3</li>
		</ul>
		<dl>
			<dt>Term 1</dt>
			<dd>Definition 1</dd>
			<dt>Term 2</dt>
			<dd>Definition 2</dd>
		</dl>
	</body>
</html>
```
