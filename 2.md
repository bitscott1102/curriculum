Now for our catch block. This is for if something goes wrong. If that happens, let's send a `500` error:

```javascript
catch { 
	res.status(500).send()
}
```

Nice job! Now, all we need is to check this using Postman. Add a new request in the task app section called 'delete users'. Since we already read in a couple users, grab their id in the clipboard. Set the method to delete, and type in `localhost:3000/users/`and then after the last `/` paste the user id of the user you want to delete. 



Great! You should see the user's information. If you try it again, you should see a 404 error, because we already deleted that user. The delete route for deleting tasks has the same structure!
