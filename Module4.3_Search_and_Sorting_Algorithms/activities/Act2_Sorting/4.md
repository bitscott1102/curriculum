If we pretend we have to sort a deck of cards, Mergesort can be thought of as dividing up the work by cutting the deck into smaller, more manageable groups and rearranging the cards before bringing it all back together.

This algorithm is a little different from the previous algorithms we learned earlier since it requires dividing up the list into smaller parts before sorting everything together. We'll use a sample list again to show the workings of each concrete step:

1. First, divide the list in half, or something close to it. It's alright if one half is bigger. This is just because there was an odd number of elements in our list. After this first division, our sample list now looks like this:

   Now, we divide again. This time, we do it on the two newly created sub-lists.

2. Keep dividing up each list in half until every original element is by itself:

3. Now, pair together elements from left to right, while sorting them. Here, we are trying to sort from smallest to largest. In our sample list, the `7` will have to be by itself:

4. Now we move on to pairing groups of elements. We make sure to sort all the elements first before combining them. After this step, our sample list will first look like this:

   We keep performing these sort-and-combine steps until we get our fully sorted list:

### Merge Sort in Python (Part I)

```python
def mergeSort(alist):
    if len(alist) > 1:
        mid = len(alist) // 2 # integer division
```

Let's start off with creating a function. If the length of the list we are looking at is greater than 1, we know it might need sorting. We first create a variable called `mid` which finds the middle position of the list. We need this to be able to do the initial splitting of the list into two equal groups. 

```python
    lefthalf = alist[:mid]
        righthalf = alist[mid:]
```

These two lines split the list into two equal groups, if possible. `lefthalf` holds all the elements of our original list from the beginning up to (*but not including*) `mid`. `righthalf` then holds all of the elements from  the `mid`, or middle, position all the way to the end.

```
    mergeSort(lefthalf)
        mergeSort(righthalf)
```

Here we use recursion to split up the two halves of our list. We simply treat each part as another list and put it through the same splitting process we just went through. We keep doing this until we get to the place where we have each element on its own and ready to be placed into pairs. The code for actually sorting the elements and combining them into groups comes next.
