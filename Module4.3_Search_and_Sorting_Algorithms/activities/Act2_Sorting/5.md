### Merge Sort in Python (Part II)

```python
        i = j = k = 0    
        while i < len(lefthalf) and j < len(righthalf):
            if lefthalf[i] <= righthalf[j]:
                alist[k]=lefthalf[i]
                i=i+1
            else:
                alist[k]=righthalf[j]
                j=j+1
            k=k+1
```

At this point, we're ready to start combining elements. We have `lefthalf`,`righthalf`, and the original `alist` from where these two halves came from. (Note: when we say "original", it only means the list which was passed to *this* particular iteration of the **mergesort** function. We could be at any step in the overall splitting-sorting-combining process). 

We create three new variables: `i`, `j`, and `k`, to keep track of our position within `lefthalf`, `righthalf`, and `alist` respectively. Now we start iterating through both `lefthalf` and `righthalf`, comparing them element-by-element. Whichever element is the smaller of the two gets placed in the appropriate position in our `alist`. We keep doing this until we finish sorting and combining all elements in both halves.

```python
        while i < len(lefthalf):
            alist[k]=lefthalf[i]
            i=i+1
            k=k+1

        while j < len(righthalf):
            alist[k]=righthalf[j]
            j=j+1
            k=k+1
```

There might be situations where we still have elements "left over" after this combining process. These elements haven't been sorted and combined yet. The most common example of this happening is when we have an odd number of elements in our main list and the two halves aren't equal. In this case, we simply tack on these elements to the end of our main list. We'll deal with them in a later step.

```python
def printList(arr): 
    for i in range(len(arr)):         
        print(arr[i],end=" ") 
    print() 
```

We use this function for when we want to print a list without any brackets or commas showing up in our output.

```python
def mergeSort(alist):
    if len(alist) > 1:
        mid = len(alist) // 2 # integer division
        lefthalf = alist[:mid]
        righthalf = alist[mid:]
        mergeSort(lefthalf)
        mergeSort(righthalf)

        i = 0
        j = 0
        k = 0
        while i < len(lefthalf) and j < len(righthalf):
            if lefthalf[i] <= righthalf[j]:
                alist[k]=lefthalf[i]
                i=i+1
            else:
                alist[k]=righthalf[j]
                j=j+1
            k=k+1

        while i < len(lefthalf):
            alist[k]=lefthalf[i]
            i=i+1
            k=k+1

        while j < len(righthalf):
            alist[k]=righthalf[j]
            j=j+1
            k=k+1

def printList(arr): 
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        print(arr[i],end=" ")
        print() 

alist = [14,46,43,27,57,41,45,21,70]
mergeSort(alist)
printList(alist)
```

Use this code to call our functions and ensure they work properly.
