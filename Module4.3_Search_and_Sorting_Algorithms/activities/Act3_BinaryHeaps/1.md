#### Binary Heaps:

One interesting data structure is a **Binary Heap**, which is a type of binary tree. A binary tree can only have 0, 1, or 2 children. Binary Heaps have the following properties:

- should be balanced (current node should have both children filled before giving a child node to its child).
- New children must be added to the left-most available position.
- Is either an instance of a Min Heap or Max Heap.

A **Min Heap** is a heap where the root has the smallest key and the keys on the nodes get larger as you go down the tree. A **Max Heap** is a heap where the root has the largest key and the keys on the nodes get smaller as you go down the tree.

Examples of **Binary Heaps**:

â€‹                                      This is a **Min Heap**.                                             This is a **Max Heap**.

#### Valid vs. Invalid Max Heaps:

While the tree on the left is a valid heap, the one on the right is not. This is because `5` has a child node of `6`, which violates the order of **Max Heaps**. Parent nodes should always be larger than child nodes. 

One useful attribute of **Binary Heaps** is the ability to find the min/max of the tree in **O(1)** time because the root of a **Min Heap** is the min of the data and the root of a **Max Heap** is the max of the data.



### Binary Heap Implementation:

Given a list of elements, we want to be able to convert it into a Binary Heap. Below is an example of a list of numbers represented by a Min Heap:

![](https://runestone.academy/runestone/books/published/pythonds/_images/heapOrder.png)

Let's briefly discuss how this tree was built given the provided `heapList`. You will notice that we have a `0` as our first element, but it is not part of our tree. This `0` was actually prepended to our actual list. We will provide the reason for this a bit later. We first have `5`, the root node. Then, we go to add `9` to the tree. Per Property 2 of Binary Heaps, we always fill the left-most available position first. So, `9` becomes `5`'s left child. 

Now we go to add `11` to the list. You might think that we follow the same rule we just followed and make `11` as `9`'s left child. But remember! Property 1 of Binary Heaps states that we must try to fill all the current node's child positions first. **This rule takes priority**. So, we make `11` as `5`'s *right* child. We can define the "current" node as the oldest node which doesn't have both children filled. We follow this same process until we get the tree seen above.

Now to view this programmatically, we will define a Binary Heap implementation representing a Min Heap. We will begin this implementation with the constructor. Since the entire binary heap can be represented by a single list, all the constructor (`__init__`) will do is initialize the list and an attribute `currentSize` to keep track of the current size of the heap. 

```python
class BinHeap:
    def __init__(self):
        self.heapList = [0]
        self.currentSize = 0 
```
