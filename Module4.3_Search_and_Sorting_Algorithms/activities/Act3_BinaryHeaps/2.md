The next method we will implement is `insert`. The easiest, and most efficient, way to add an item to a list is to simply append the item to the end of the list. The good news about appending is that it guarantees that we will maintain the complete tree property. The bad news about appending is that we will very likely violate the heap structure property. However, it is possible to write a method that will allow us to regain the heap structure property by comparing the newly added item with its parent. If the newly added item is less than its parent, then we can swap the item with its parent. The figure below shows the series of swaps needed to percolate the newly added item up to its proper position in the tree:

Notice that when we percolate an item up, we are restoring the heap-order property between the newly added item and the parent. We are also preserving the heap-order property for any siblings. Of course, if the newly added item is very small, we may still need to swap it up another level. In fact, we may need to keep swapping until we get to the top of the tree. 

```python
def percUp(self,i):
    while i // 2 > 0:
```

Here, we define the `percUp` method, which will actually be responsible for placing the new node in its proper place. The while loop states that we keep percolating the node upwards as long as  `i // 2` is greater than 0. But why is this the case? *Here* is where the "wasted" `0` in our `heapList` comes into play. Let's take a look at that list again:

In order to perform the necessary compare-and-swap operations to make `percUp` work, we will need to find a node's parent. Adding a `0` to the start of our list is a neat trick that makes this really easy. If we have the index `i` of the current node (which we always will), we can find the index of the parent node by simply dividing `i` by 2.  Let's test this.

Let's say that we want to find the parent of `9`, which is in position 2 of our list. Looking back to our tree, we can see that we should be getting `5` as the answer. Per the trick, we simply take `9`'s index, 2 and divide by 2. The result is 1, index 1 to be exact. The number occupying index 1 in our list is `5`, which is exactly what we wanted! 

We will try this one more time just to make sure. Let's try `11` this time. `11`'s parent node is also `5`, so we should be getting the same answer as we got for `9`. `11` is occupying position 3 in our list. The quotient when you divide 3 by 2, is 1. In other words, `11`'s parent is in index 1 of the list, which is correct again! As a result, the initial while loop in `percUp` simply states tat we keep percolating upwards as long as we haven't reached the root node.

```python
	if self.heapList[i] < self.heapList[i // 2]:
         tmp = self.heapList[i // 2]
         self.heapList[i // 2] = self.heapList[i]
         self.heapList[i] = tmp
    i = i // 2
```

This is the bulk of the function, and also the most straightforward part of its workings. We simply compare the current node to its parent, and if it is smaller we swap them. We then change index `i` to the index of the parent node to repeat the process.

We are now ready to write the `insert` method (see below). Most of the work in the `insert` method is really done by `percUp`. Once a new item is appended to the tree, `percUp` takes over and positions the new item properly.

```python
def insert(self,k):
    self.heapList.append(k)
    self.currentSize = self.currentSize + 1
    self.percUp(self.currentSize)
```
