The time complexity for delete is also O(n), because in the worst case it will visit every node, interacting with each node a fixed number of times.

The `delete()` function for our linked list goes through the list, and keeps track of the current node, `current`, while also remembering the node it last visited, `previous`. 

```python
def delete(self, data):
    current = self.head
    previous = None
    found = False
```
In order to delete an element, the `delete()` function goes through the list until it arrives to the node that it wants to delete. When it arrives, it takes a look at the previous node it visited and resets that node's `next_node` to point at the node that comes after the one-to-be-deleted. 

```python
    while current and found is False:
        if current.get_data() == data:
            found = True
        else:
            previous = current
            current = current.get_next()
```
Afterwards, we add several statements in the case that the data doesn't exist in the list, moving onto the next node if we're at the "head" node, and moving through the list node by node. 

```python
    if current is None:
        raise ValueError("Data not in list")
    if previous is None:
        self.head = current.get_next()
    else:
        previous.set_next(current.get_next())
```
When the previous node's `next_node` points at the next node in line, then no nodes will point at the current node, meaning that the current node has now been deleted!

In our `main()` function later on, deleting a node from a linked list will look as follows:

```python
film.delete(1000)
```
