Now, if we want to find a certain node in our linked list, we can use a search method!

As mentioned before, `search()` is rather similar to `size()` in that it also (at worst-case scenario) has to travel through the entire linked list. 

```python
def search(self, data):
    current = self.head
    found = False
    while current and found is False:
```    
At each node, the `search()` function will check to see if the data matches the data it's looking for. If so, then it will return the node that holds the requested data. If not, then it will just continue to go to the next node.

```python
        if current.get_data() == data:
            found = True
        else:
            current = current.get_next()
```            
Should the function not find the data at all, it will return an error notifying the user that the data is not in the list. **Note: If the function goes through the entire list without finding the data, that is also our worst-case scenario, meaning our worst-case time complexity is O(N).**

```python
    if current is None:
        raise ValueError("Data not in list")
    return current
```
When we call it, it should look like this:

```python
print(film.search(1000))
```
Below is a visual representation of searching for an element in a linked list.

Now that we've covered how to implement and create the different functions and attributes of a linked list, we can put everything together!
