<!--title={Separate Route Files Pt. 2}-->

<!--concepts={web development}-->

Let's use the structure from the previous card for all of our routers. Create a new folder in the source directory called *routers* . This will contain all of our route files. Create a file called *user.js* that will define our user routes.



Keep in mind that we are moving functions from the *index.js* file into the new *user.js* file. This will simplify our code so that our *index.js* file isn't getting too cluttered!

```javascript
const express = require('express')
const User = require('../models/user')
const router = new express.Router()
```

The above has all of the necessary import statements. Now, we need to add the functions themselves! Notice, you change `app` to `router` since it's in a separate file and we're exporting the router. The function from below is cut from *index.js* and pasted into *user.js*. 

```javascript
router.post('/users', async(req,res) => { 
  const user = new User(req, body)
  
  try { 
  	await user.save()
    res.status(201).send(user)
  } catch(e) { 
  	res.status(400).send(e)
  }
})

//We've added the post function for you! Add the other users functions here!
```

The last statement we need is to export our file!

```javascript
module.exports = router
```
